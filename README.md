# SensitivitySimple

This code implements a sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies for sum statistics, statistics of the form T = Z'q where Z is the treatment assignment vector and q is a function of the observed responses which is fixed assuming the truth of a sharp null hypothesis. The method solves a quadratic integer program and is described in Section F of the supplementary material of Fogarty et al. (2017), ``Randomization Inference and Sensitivity Analysis for Composite Null Hypotheses With Binary Outcomes in Matched Observational Studies"
